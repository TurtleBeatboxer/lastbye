        Through our lives, we choose our own path - we try new hobbies, jobs, foods or travel until we figure out how we want to live.<br /><br />
        The idea came up to me one evening when I was trying to find an application which I could use to clearly convey and tell a certain
        story for my loved ones to reenact when I am no longer here.<br /><br />
        Our projects will help you to take control over your last day and help your family and friends to properly spend and celebrate this
        special moment.<br /><br />

        We want to create platform where people can describe in a clear and simple way how they want their last day look like.<br /><br />
        While becoming older, we start to think further more about death. It is when people realize they have specific needs for their last
        day on earth. That’s why it is important for us that each Person can leave personalized legacy on their own terms.<br /><br />
